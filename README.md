# WWARA CHIRP Export Script Update

### **Note: This is a work in progress. The script is mostly functional, and the documentation is aspirational.** 
Please report any issues or bugs you encounter, and feel free to contribute to the
documentation or code.

## Overview
This repository contains an updated CHIRP export script for the Western
Washington Amateur Relay Association ([WWARA](https://www.wwara.org/)). 

WWARA maintains a database of coordinated repeaters west of the Cascade
Mountains in Washington State, between the Canadian border and the Oregon
borders. WWARA publishes a nightly extract of their database in various CSV 
variations. 

This script is intended to be used with the WWARA-rptrlist-DATE.csv file. The 
v2.x.x updates address a longstanding format change for CHIRP import files, 
moving away from XML in favor of CSV due to improved compatibility and 
reliability. These updates also implement a modern Python packaging structure
to facilitate installation, especially managing dependencies.

## Background
CHIRP, an open-source tool for programming amateur radios, initially supported
XML as an import format for radio frequency data. However, the XML import
feature had issues, including strict schema requirements and formatting
constraints that frequently resulted in validation errors. Users experienced
challenges due to the XML schema’s rigidity, which required fields in precise
order and allowed minimal flexibility. These limitations hindered
interoperability and led to CHIRP adopting CSV as the preferred import format.
CSV files are easier to create and maintain, and they seamlessly integrate with
CHIRP’s features, allowing users to import frequency data across a wide range of
supported radios without the schema-related errors encountered with XML.

## Prerequisites
wwara_chirp is tested on python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13

## Installation
To install the package, you can use pip to install the package from PyPI for 
the latest stable release. 
    ```bash
    pip install -i wwara-chirp
    ```    
or from the test PyPI for the latest pre-release version.

   ```bash
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ wwara-chirp
   ```  

you can also upgrade the package to the latest stable version.
    ```bash
    pip install -i --upgrade wwara-chirp
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
To export WWARA repeater data for CHIRP programming, run the script with the
following command:
* `wwara_chirp <input_file> <output_file>`

* `<input_file>` is the CSV file containing WWARA repeater data and
* `<output_file>` is the CSV file to be generated for CHIRP import. (Be sure the
  output_file does not exist.)
  
The script is intended to read the daily WWARA input file, convert the data to
CHIRP format, and write the output file in CSV format for CHIRP import. The
output file should be imported to a new CHIRP channel list, and specific entries
can be copy and pasted to the desired radio memory channels of the user's radio
file.

### REST API Interface
The package now includes a REST API server for web-based conversion. This allows
websites and web applications to convert WWARA data to CHIRP format through HTTP
requests.

#### Starting the REST API Server
```bash
# Start the server on localhost:5000
python -c "from wwara_chirp.rest_api import run_server; run_server()"

# Or start on a specific host/port
python -c "from wwara_chirp.rest_api import run_server; run_server(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)"
```

#### API Endpoints

**Health Check**
```bash
GET /api/health
```

**API Information**
```bash
GET /api/info
```

**Validate WWARA CSV**
```bash
POST /api/validate
Content-Type: application/json
{"csv_data": "...csv content..."}
```

**Convert WWARA CSV to CHIRP Format**
```bash
# File upload
POST /api/convert
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Form field: file (CSV file)

# Raw CSV data
POST /api/convert
Content-Type: text/csv
Body: CSV content

# JSON with CSV data
POST /api/convert
Content-Type: application/json
{"csv_data": "...csv content..."}
```

**Download Converted File**
```bash
GET /api/download/<file_id>
```

#### Example Usage
```bash
# Test with curl - file upload
curl -X POST -F "file=@WWARA-rptrlist.csv" http://localhost:5000/api/convert

# Test with curl - raw CSV
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/csv" --data-binary @WWARA-rptrlist.csv http://localhost:5000/api/convert

# Test validation
curl -X POST -F "file=@WWARA-rptrlist.csv" http://localhost:5000/api/validate
```

## Future Plans
As CHIRP evolves, this script will be maintained to reflect any new updates or 
changes in CHIRP\’s file compatibility. Contributions and 
[bug reports](https://github.com/tsayles/wwara-chirp/issues) are welcome and 
encouraged, as the goal is to provide a reliable and user-friendly tool for 
WWARA members and other amateur radio operators.
